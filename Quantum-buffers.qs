// Explanation:
// 1. Buffer Allocation:
// AllocateBuffer dynamically creates an array of qubits to represent a quantum buffer. A message logs the allocation.
// 
// 2. Buffer Usage:
// UseBuffer applies a set of operations (e.g., Hadamard gates) to all qubits in the buffer, simulating the use of allocated quantum memory.
// 
// 3. Garbage Collection:
// FreeBuffer ensures all qubits are reset to their ground state before deallocation to prevent quantum garbage from affecting future computations.
// 
// 4. Management Workflow:
// ManageBuffersAndGarbageCollection integrates allocation, usage, and deallocation for comprehensive buffer management.
// 
// 5. Entry Point:
// The Main operation demonstrates the process, initializing a buffer size and invoking the management routine.

// Namespace and Imports
